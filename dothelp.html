<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The purpose of
this application is to assist with trailer inspections required for
DOT compliance or preventative maintenance. It initiates automatic
tests and retrieves the results via the Trailer Interface and sends
them, along with user-entered information, to the Lite-Check Cloud
for storage and report generation.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The philosophy
of the Lite-Check DOT inspection app is to collect all data during a
single pass around the trailer with a minimum of wasted movement, and
the inspection process is ordered with that in mind. While it is
possible to move back and forth between screens, we strongly
recommend that you follow the order in which they appear.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="using"></A>Using The Application</H3>
<P>Upon starting the application you'll be presented with a login
dialog.  You must enter valid credentials for an active Lite-Check
Cloud account.  Note that the password is case-sensitive.  The first
time you execute the application on a device you will need to type
in the username, but on subsequent executions a drop-down list will
be available with the names of all valid users and you only need enter
the password.  If the tablet does not currently have wi-fi you will be
allowed to proceed with inspections using cached data and the reports
will be saved until they can be successfully uploaded to the cloud.</P>
<P>At any time you can switch between DOT (inspection) mode and diagnostic mode.
The former is used for DOT and preventative maintenance inspections,
the latter is used for troubleshooting known problems with the ABS
system, the air system, or specific electrical circuits.  Toggle modes by
selecting the icon in the toolbar. <B>Please
note</B> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">that
if you plan to generate a report while in diagnostic mode and wish to
include information about the inspector, company, and/or trailer, you
should select DOT mode and enter all necessary data on the first
screen and then switch to diagnostic mode.</SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Note:</B></SPAN>
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">please do not connect the Trailer
Interface to the trailer at this point! </SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">After entering your user credentials
you're presented with the selection screen.  Select your shop location from
the drop-down list (it will default to your home location) and enter a work
order number (if applicable).  Select a tractor or trailer by either scanning the barcode to read the ID or selecting
it from the drop-down list.  If you have a large number of trailers
start typing the first few characters and the result list will be filtered to
IDs that match.  If you're inspecting a new trailer for the first time and
it has not yet been added to the cloud, press the "New" button and carefully
enter all the details (if no New button is shown, you do not have access to
add new entries from the tablet; have your supervisor or manager add the trailer
via the cloud website).  Be sure the configuration
information is correct: number of axles, ABS, disc or drum brakes and
the tire type.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">If the trailer ID
is encoded in a barcode, press the &ldquo;Scan&rdquo; button and use
the tablet's camera to read the encoded value. Please note:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">Supported
	barcode types are Code 39, Code 128, UPC A, and UPC E</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">Ensure
	adequate lighting when scanning</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">The barcode
	should be roughly centered and fill at least half of the narrowest
	dimension of the screen</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">Orientation
	does not matter (horizontal, vertical, or in between)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">If the image

</UL>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">If the trailer is
not equipped with ABS, has an older unit that does not use PLC, or is
not supported, please uncheck the &ldquo;ABS equipped&rdquo; box at
the bottom of the Trailer screen. Failure to do so will result in an
out-of-service inspection status due to inability to communicate with
the ABS ECU. Please use alternate means to verify the ABS (if any) is
functioning properly.   Similarly, if drum brakes are specified on a
trailer with disc brakes, the inspector will be prompted for applied
brake stroke measurements which are not applicable.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">Before hitting "Save" make sure the appropriate inspection
type is selected.  The drop-down list will always default to DOT, but the
inspector may select a preventative maintenance inspection or a custom inspection
based on the unit type of the specified trailer.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Loading a Previous Inspection</B></SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">If you wish to resume an unfinished inspection or make changes once repairs are complete,
select "Open" from the menu in the upper right-hand corner. Note, however, that you should never load a previous inspection
to perform a subsequent PM or DOT inspection on the same trailer at a later date.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">If you elect to
load a previous inspection, a dialog will appear listing
all available files. If there are many, you can more easily find
what you're looking for by typing the first
digit or two of the trailer ID. The results will be filtered to show only
those starting with what you've typed. You can also sort by ID
or date. Clicking on the respective label will
toggle between no sorting (the initial default), ascending order, or
descending order. If you sort by both ID and date, the files will be
sorted first by ID, and then within files of the same name,
by date. Inspections can be deleted from within this
dialog by holding your finger on the selected entry until a
confirmation dialog appears.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Beginning
the Inspection</B></SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">This walk-through assumes that the
standard Lite-Check DOT inspection has been selected.  Custom inspections
will vary, of course.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">The inspection begins at the front of the trailer since that is where the
Trailer Interface is connected. Start with a visual inspection of the
gladhands and 7-way connector, then power on the Trailer Interface
unit </SPAN><I>before connecting the air lines to the trailer</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">.
The pressure sensors are calibrated on start-up and must be at
atmospheric pressure. Once the calibration message disappears from
the LCD screen you may connect the air lines and 7-way connector to
the trailer.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">Continue with your
visual inspection of the items listed on the &ldquo;Front Damage&rdquo;
screen, marking each as &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; &ldquo;OOS&rdquo;
(out-of-service), or NA (not applicable). Once all inspection items
on this screen have been completed, press &ldquo;Save&rdquo; at the
bottom to proceed.</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">The
next step is the automated circuit, ABS, and air leak tests. The
tablet should have already connected via Bluetooth to the Trailer
Interface. If the Bluetooth icon doesn't have &ldquo;waves&rdquo;
emanating from it, tap it and select your tester from the list.
If your Verifier doesn't appear in the list, go to <A HREF="#appa">Appendix A</A> for
troubleshooting tips.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">By default, the
emergency air system will be charged at the completion of the ABS
test in preparation for the automated background air leak test. If
you do not wish for that to occur, uncheck the &ldquo;Run Air Leak
Test&rdquo; box. Hit &ldquo;Run Tests&rdquo; to start the circuit and
ABS tests. You may hit the info (&ldquo;i&rdquo;) button under either
progress bar while the tests are running to get real-time details as
they are retrieved from the Trailer Interface, or you may hit Save to
continue with the visual inspection while the tests finish in the
background. These tests may not be skipped, so the &ldquo;Save&rdquo;
button will be disabled until the tests are started.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">The air leak test
(if selected) runs automatically in the background while you continue
the inspection.  At the completion of the ABS test it will begin
charging the emergency air system.  When the pressure exceeds 100
PSI, it will open the service valve to charge those lines as well. 
When pressure peaks and stabilizes, the air leak test will begin
automatically and run for 60 seconds, monitoring any air lost in
either system.  A brief status message at the bottom of the screen
keeps the user informed of the test's progress.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">Continue
performing the indicated visual inspections on each page, selecting
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; &ldquo;OOS,&rdquo; or &ldquo;NA&rdquo; (not
applicable) for each item. The heading for each screen will indicate
the current inspection point, with an icon in the upper right to
visually indicate front, left, rear, right, top, or undercarriage.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">Whenever the note
icon is visible at the bottom of the screen (to the left of the
&ldquo;Save&rdquo; button) you may add a note and/or picture for an
inspection item. If you see an item of concern that is not
specifically listed, select &ldquo;General&rdquo; from the list,
enter a note, take a picture of the item, and optionally select the
&ldquo;out of service&rdquo; checkbox to have the item flagged on the
report.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">At any point after
the automated tests are completed you may select &ldquo;Return to
overhead view&rdquo; to select a previous inspection point. This is
especially useful if you have loaded a previous inspection and you
want to review a specific area.  If for some reason you wish to
discontinue an inspection in progress, select "Cancel Inspection"
from the menu.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">There are visual
inspection screens for the lights on the left, rear, and right sides
of the trailer. For each of these screens, press the appropriate
light button and visually confirm that the lights illuminate. The
automated electrical test has already measured voltage and current
for each circuit and detected shorts or opens, but if a single bulb
in a multi-light circuit is out it can only be detected visually.</P>
<P>For the left and right tire screens, the currently selected tire
is highlighted in red. Any notes and/or pictures will apply to that
tire. To enter the tire pressure and tread depth in their respective
fields, tap on a tire and a dialog will appear. Indicate the
condition with the buttons (good, bulge, cut, nail, separation or
flat spot).</P>
<P>If you have the optional Bluetooth tire pressure and tread depth
gauge the values will automatically be applied to each tire in
sequence. Start by taking one or more tread depth measurements at
various points along the surface of the outer tire on the first axle.
You may take as many measurements as you wish and the shallowest
point will be recorded. The tablet will emit an audible tone each
time a measurement is taken as a confirmation, but if the reading is
greater than or equal to the currently displayed value it will not
change. When you are done taking tread depth measurements, read the
tire pressure and the next tire will automatically be selected. The
order is outer tire then inner tire, repeating for each axle in
sequence. Tire conditions, if any, must still be entered manually via the
dialog as above. You can also take measurements with the dialog open.
In this mode, the tire does not automatically advance after each
pressure reading, and when you first open the dialog you may override
an earlier tread depth measurement (i.e., the minimum is reset for
that tire).</P>
<P>On the Air Brakes screen, select each position in turn and enter
the values for the applied brake stroke (for drum brakes) and pad
thickness. Brake stroke is measured by pressing the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;
button to apply and release the brakes.  The brake stroke field and
service air buttons will not be displayed if disc brakes were
selected on the Trailer screen.</P>
<P>After completion of all inspection screens, a summary dialog will
appear listing all items that were found to be OOS. If notes or
pictures were added for those items, those will be displayed as well.
If everything appears to be correct, press &ldquo;Submit&rdquo; to
send the inspection report to the Lite-Check Cloud for storage and
printing. If one or more items are incorrect, press &ldquo;Modify&rdquo;
to go back and re-run tests, enter skipped values, or change items
that were inadvertently marked OOS.</P>
<P>Upon submission, an electronic signature will be required for all
DOT inspections.  Sign your name and press &ldquo;Submit&rdquo;.
Custom inspections can specify whether or not a
signature is required.  The signature will appear on the inspection
report.</P>
<P>After the report is submitted you may hit the &ldquo;New
Inspection&rdquo; button to begin the process again for another
trailer, or simply hit the Home button or select another application.
Do not use the Android task manager to close the app since report
submission may not be complete. It runs in the background, and may
take several seconds for reports with multiple pictures or if several
inspections were performed while not connected to wi-fi.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="tiretool"></A>Notes on the Bluetooth tire pressure and tread
depth gauge</H3>
<P>If you purchased a tire tool with a tablet or full Verifier system
the tablet and tool should already be paired with each other.  Power on
the tool and launch the DOT app on the tablet, then press the Bluetooth
icon in the upper left-hand corner.  You should see "Trans-Logik" in the
list with a serial number matching that on the tool's label.  Tap that
item, and within a few seconds the tool should be connected as indicated
by an icon in the upper right.  You should only need to do this the first
time.  For each subsequent use, if the tool is on when the tablet app
is launched it will automatically reconnect.</P>
<P>If you purchased a tire tool later as an add-on it must be paired with 
the tablet.  Please refer to <A href="#appa">Appendix A</A>
</P>
<P>On all screens except the very first app screen and the diagnostic
screen you should see an icon in the toolbar depicting the tool. 
This icon serves as an indicator that the tool is connected via
Bluetooth, an indicator of the approximate battery charge level,
and a means for opening the calibration dialog.  The icon background
will be green if the battery has a full or nearly full charge.  If it
turns yellow the battery should be sufficient for several more inspections
but should be charged soon.  If it turns red the tool should be charged
as soon as possible.  Note that as with any battery, the state of charge
can be affected dramatically by temperature:  battery life at 40 degrees
will be very noticeably shorter than battery life at 70 degrees.</P>
<P>The tool should be calibrated at intervals recommended by the manufacturer, or
if readings are not accurate.  Calibration requires the metal
cylinder that came with your Trans-Logik tool, and a known 100 PSI
air source with a Schrader valve.  Follow the instructions in the
calibration dialog for each of the four steps.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="diag"></A>Diagnostic Mode</H3>
<P>Diagnostic mode is intended for troubleshooting problems with ABS,
air leaks, or light circuits. As noted above, if you wish to submit a
diagnostic report that contains information about the inspector,
company, and trailer, please start in DOT mode and enter the
necessary information in the first three screens, then switch to
diagnostic mode. If no information is entered and you submit a
diagnostic report you will be redirected back to these initial screens
to gather the necessary data for the report.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><B>ABS</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">The ABS test in diagnostic mode is
interactive. Press the &ldquo;ABS&rdquo; button to begin. It will
take a few moments for the system to check the brake and auxiliary
light and read information from the ECU. Once that is complete it
will display the manufacturer and other summary information. Use the
up and down arrows on the screen to scroll through available pages of
information and select the hyperlinks of interest to you. You may
view active and stored faults, including help information about
addressing these issues. It is also possible to reset codes if
supported by the ECU, and view wheel speed information.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Air</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">The air leak test in diagnostic mode
will remain active until you shut it off so you can continue to
monitor both starting pressures and current pressures. You may select
Emergency only or both Emergency and Service for the air leak test.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Lights</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Press any light button to get
real-time information on the voltage, current, and condition of the
selected circuit. If a short or open is detected, the alarm will
sound. Note that since most lights are wired in parallel, a bulb that
is not illuminating will most likely not cause an open circuit.</P>
